<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
<p><strong>Static Memory Allocation for a Synthesized Soft-Core CPU (April 2020 - Present):</strong> Improving a Clang based C compiler for a custom CPU called VerySimpleCPU (VSCPU). This project is funded by T&Uuml;BITAK (Turkish NSF). VSCPU was designed by Prof. H. Fatih Ugurdag's team. It has a small instruction set, which has "instruction set completeness". The improvement to the compiler involves adding a static memory allocation instead of emulating a stack. Since VSCPU does not have stack-based instructions, a statically memory mapped application has smaller program and data memory footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual FPGA Board (September 2020 - Present):</strong> &nbsp;An FPGA board simulator intended to be used in distance education, developed using Verilator. A GUI was designed using Qt framework. The GUI replicates a typical FPGA board with virtual LEDs, push buttons, switches, and a seven-segment display. The GUI and the Verilator model communicate through UDP packets.</p>
<p><strong>High Frequency Electric Motor Control IP (August 2019 - Present):</strong> The IP controls BLDC motors on Xilinx Zynq SoCs. This project was funded by T&Uuml;BITAK. Designed RTL modules running on Zynq PL. Conducted component level simulation tests and system level FPGA-in-the-Loop verification in MATLAB. Wrote a software for monitoring/controlling the motors, running on the Zynq PS. Developed Qt based desktop application, communicating with the Zynq FPGA.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Door Locking System (February 2020 - June 2020):</strong> A web application with scheduled and on-request locking/unlocking system using a Raspberry Pi. The application supports a calendar view showing the schedule of a door. The app. supports multiple doors. The doors can be opened manually utilizing face recognition or automatically when the scheduled time arrives. The app. utilizes a database for keeping track of the schedules and users. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>High Frequency Trading on FPGA using HLS (July 2019 - August 2019):</strong> This is an implementation of the &ldquo;Limit Order Book&rdquo; algorithm for HFT on an FPGA equipped NIC using HLS. The program using Xilinx Vivado HLS. The algorithm utilizes a heap structure for keeping track of orders. Buyer and seller orders are matched as fast as possible according to their prices.</p>
<p><strong>Parametrized FPGA Video Flow (September 2018 - June 2019):</strong> &nbsp;A set of parametrized video processing algorithms implemented on an FPGA. The algorithms include histogram equalization, median filter, and fish-eye lens distortion correction. Project was done in cooperation with Yonga Technology Microelectronics R&amp;D and Prof. H. Fatih Ugurdag.</p>
<p><strong>Laser Object Tracking (February 2018 - June 2018):</strong> A Raspberry Pi application that tracks an object and points a laser pointer at it. The project utilized OpenCV library and was written in Python.</p>
